# ECSE415 
# Introduction to Computer Vision
During this course, the student will acquire a broad understanding of a variety of problems
addressed by researchers in the field of computer vision. These include (but are not
limited to): image formation, filtering and image enhancement, image matching, image
features, feature alignment and stitching, grouping and matching, stereo, motion and
optical flow estimation, segmentation, scene understanding, face detection and
recognition, classifiers, deep learning and medical image analysis. Students will be given
an overview of designing and programming in Python and OpenCV in the context of
solving practical problems in the field of computer vision. By the end of the course, the
students should be able to apply, in a design context, their acquired programming skills
to address a wide variety of problems in computer vision.
